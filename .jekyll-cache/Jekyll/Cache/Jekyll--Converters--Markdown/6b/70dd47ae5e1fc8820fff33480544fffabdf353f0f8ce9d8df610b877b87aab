<p>In this excercise, I will show how to make visualizations out of data from multiple sources. This will enable you to visualize comparisons and combinations of data, which will allow sharing more complex projects.</p>

<p>This viz will show the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2010-2011, comparing CO2 emissions between countries from year to year, but also provides information about each county‚Äôs population, GDP, and energy use.</p>

<p>From the Connect to Data window, go to the Files tab and open the CO2 dataset you downloaded earlier.</p>

<p>Now, from the Data Source tab on the bottom of the interface, go to the Connections header at the top of the left-side column.</p>

<p>img01</p>

<p>Click the + icon to add another data source. Start with the energy dataset.</p>

<p>Repeat step 5 for the other datasets, gdptotal and totalpopulation.</p>

<p>Now, you should have all four datasets loaded into Tableau. The datasets will be on the left-hand side of your screen under Connections.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice that Tableau has already added one of the data sources into the area Multiple Connections. In the screenshot below, Energy is already loaded.</p>

<p>Question 1</p>

<p>Activity overview</p>

<p>In earlier activities, you worked in Tableau to create a data visualization. In this activity, you will review a scenario, link different data sources in Tableau, and create visualizations using multiple datasets.</p>

<p>By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to make visualizations out of data from multiple sources. This will enable you to visualize comparisons and combinations of data, which will allow you to share more complex projects in your career as a data analyst.</p>

<p>What you will need
Click the link to create a copy of the datasets and download them. If you don‚Äôt have a Google account, download the datasets directly from the attachments below.</p>

<p>Link to datasets: CO2, energy, total population, and gdp total</p>

<p>The scenario</p>

<p>Imagine you are working as a data analyst at a policy research institute. For your current project, you need to create a visualization that shows the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2000-2011. You need to provide a visual presentation that not only allows someone to visually compare CO2 emissions between countries from year to year, but also provides information about each county‚Äôs population, GDP, and energy use.</p>

<p>You already have a dataset that includes emissions for each country between the years 1960 - 2011. But, the information that you need on energy use, total population, and GDP you had to collect from a government website. Each dataset is in a separate file. Moreover, some of the information is missing for some countries.</p>

<p>Often you will work with datasets that are missing information. Whether or not you need to find this missing information will depend on your project. In this case, you will notice that the missing information is from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p>

<p>Luckily, your project is only concerned with the data from 2000-2011. You need an efficient way to utilize some data from one source, and some data from other sources. Taking just the information that you need from each source and creating a new data source takes a lot of time.</p>

<p>Tableau allows you to link data from different sources, as well as import data from different formats. While you won‚Äôt be working with one in this assignment, Tableau allows you to use a Web Data Connector. This tool allows you to import the data you need directly from another site. Your visualizations will update when the data sources for your visualization are updated.</p>

<p>Load the data</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to Tableau Public.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Tableau frequently updates its user interface. The latest changes may not be reflected in the screenshots, but the principles in this activity remain the same. Adapting to changes in software updates is an essential skill for data analysts, and we encourage you to practice troubleshooting. You can also reach out to your community of learners on the discussion forum for help.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to your profile and click Create a Viz.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Connect to Data window, go to the Files tab and open the CO2 dataset you downloaded earlier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Data Source tab on the bottom of the interface, go to the Connections header at the top of the left-side column.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the + icon to add another data source. Start with the energy dataset.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat step 5 for the other datasets, gdptotal and totalpopulation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you should have all four datasets loaded into Tableau. The datasets will be on the left-hand side of your screen under Connections.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice that Tableau has already added one of the data sources into the area Multiple Connections. In the screenshot below, Energy is already loaded.</p>

<p>tableau public page. the energy file is selected
If one of the datasets has already been loaded in, you can remove it by dragging the box to the left-hand side (the grey area) of the screen. Click on the box labeled Energy in the center-top of the screen and drag it off to the left to delete it.</p>

<p>Once you remove the data from Multiple Connections, it should appear similar to the image below.</p>

<p>Image of connections menu. totalpopulation data is highlighted in gray
Note: As you progress through the activity, make sure to save your progress by clicking File &gt; Save or the Save icon. If you are asked to ‚ÄúCreate an Extract,‚Äù do so. It may take some time to create an extract of the data you are using in this activity, but it is essential to saving your progress.</p>

<p>Make connections with JOINs</p>

<p>Now, you‚Äôll set up the connections between the different datasets by creating JOINs between them. You learned about JOINs in the previous course.</p>

<p>As a refresher: INNER JOINs and OUTER JOINs are types of relationships that can be used to combine data based on common columns of information.</p>

<p>In Tableau, you‚Äôll notice that the former JOINs window has now become a multi-purpose Relationships window. By double-clicking your data tables, you can edit the JOINs instead of the relationships.</p>

<p>Follow these instructions to create JOINs in Tableau:</p>

<p>Click on CO2 under Connections.</p>

<p>Under Sheets, you will notice all the different sheets in the CO2 dataset. Find CO2 Data Cleaned and double-click on it to load it.</p>

<p>Hover your cursor over the right side of the CO2 Data Cleaned box and click on the arrow.</p>

<p>Select Open to open the CO2 Data Cleaned dataset. Make sure you complete this step. This allows you to change the physical table, which will allow you to create JOINs. Otherwise, you will only be able to edit Relationships. Usually, you could use either option to accomplish the same goal. But for the purposes of this activity, we specifically want to use JOINs.</p>

<p>Your screen should appear similar to the screenshot below:</p>

<p>img03</p>

<p>Click on the energy dataset under Connections.</p>

<p>Drag the energy sheet across from the CO2 Data Cleaned box under Multiple Connections. A pop-up window for a Join will appear.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The popup window may automatically populate with Year from CO2 Data Cleaned and Year1 from Energy. If not, put Year on the left side of the chart and Year1 on the right side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on Add new join clause under Year. A dropdown menu will appear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Country Name on the left side and Country on the right side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the X to close the dropdown menu.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
