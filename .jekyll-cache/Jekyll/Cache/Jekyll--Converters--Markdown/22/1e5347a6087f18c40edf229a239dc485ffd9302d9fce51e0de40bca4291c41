<h2>Occupations</h2>

<p>Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.</p>

<p>Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.</p>

<p>The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:</p>

<table style="width:100%" border="">
  <tr>
    <td>Column&lt;/th&gt;
    <td>Type&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Occupation</td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
&lt;/table&gt;

Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.


**Sample Output**

<table>
    <tr><td>Jenny</td><td>Ashley</td><td>Meera</td><td>Jane</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Samantha</td><td>Christeen</td><td>Priya</td><td>Julia</td></tr>
    <tr><td>NULL</td><td>Ketty</td><td>NULL</td><td>Maria</td></tr>
</table>

**Explanation**

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

<h2>Solution:</h2>

For this challenge I divide the problem into two parts. In order to transpose the table we first need to create another list with a subquery, checking professions row by row. This will return a row with one value (name) per row, other colums will be NULL, plus the count of that profession at the end, named ROW_NUM.
<br /><br />
Once executed this subquery and stored as TEMP, we use GROUP BY ROW_NUM. This, combined with the aggregation functions at the beggining will return the expected table. I used MIN but could have been any aggregation, since only action needed here is to take the name out of the NULLs.
<br /><br />
```sql
SET @d = 0, @p = 0, @s = 0, @a = 0;
SELECT MIN(DOCTOR_NAMES), MIN(PROFESSOR_NAMES), MIN(SINGER_NAMES), MIN(ACTOR_NAMES)
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN NAME END AS DOCTOR_NAMES,
        CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN NAME END AS PROFESSOR_NAMES,
        CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN NAME END AS SINGER_NAMES,
        CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN NAME END AS ACTOR_NAMES,
        CASE
            WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN (@d := @d + 1)
            WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN (@p := @p + 1)
            WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN (@s := @s + 1)
            WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN (@a := @a + 1)
            END AS ROW_NUM
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    ORDER BY NAME
    ) AS TEMP
GROUP BY ROW_NUM;
```
