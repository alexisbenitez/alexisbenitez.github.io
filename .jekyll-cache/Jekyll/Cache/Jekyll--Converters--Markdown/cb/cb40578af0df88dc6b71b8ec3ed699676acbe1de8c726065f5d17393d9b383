<p>In this excercise, I will show how to make visualizations out of data from multiple sources. This will enable you to visualize comparisons and combinations of data, which will allow sharing more complex projects.</p>

<p>This viz will shows the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2000-2011. You need to provide a visual presentation that not only allows someone to visually compare CO2 emissions between countries from year to year, but also provides information about each countyâ€™s population, GDP, and energy use.</p>

<p>You already have a dataset that includes emissions for each country between the years 1960 - 2011. But, the information that you need on energy use, total population, and GDP you had to collect from a government website. Each dataset is in a separate file. Moreover, some of the information is missing for some countries.</p>

<p>Often you will work with datasets that are missing information. Whether or not you need to find this missing information will depend on your project. In this case, you will notice that the missing information is from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p>

<p>Luckily, your project is only concerned with the data from 2000-2011. You need an efficient way to utilize some data from one source, and some data from other sources. Taking just the information that you need from each source and creating a new data source takes a lot of time.</p>

<p>Tableau allows you to link data from different sources, as well as import data from different formats. While you wonâ€™t be working with one in this assignment, Tableau allows you to use a Web Data Connector. This tool allows you to import the data you need directly from another site. Your visualizations will update when the data sources for your visualization are updated.</p>
